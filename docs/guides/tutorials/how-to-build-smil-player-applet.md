# How to build SMIL Player Applet

Following guide provides steps to build your version of SMIL Player from Github repository and uploading it to signageOS DevSpace.

## Prerequisites:

1. signageOS Account
1. created Organization in Box (create one here)
1. Node.js >= 16
1. NPM
1. a shell/terminal environment (like bash, zsh, powershell...)
1. a source-code editor (like VSCode, Sublime, WebStorm...)

## Create an Applet
1. First, navigate to signageOS Box -> Applets -> [New Applet](https://box.signageos.io/applet/new)
1. Create a new Applet
1. Once created, get the Applet UID, we will need it later in the process in Step 5

## Clone signageOS SMIL Player repository
In your favorite terminal, use the following commands:

```shell title="Clonning from official SMIL Player repository"
git clone https://github.com/signageos/smil-player.git
cd ./smil-player
```

The repository is located on signageOS Github account: [https://github.com/signageos/smil-player](https://github.com/signageos/smil-player)

## Install signageOS CLI and additional libraries

```shell
npm install @signageos/cli@latest -g
npm i -SE @signageos/front-display
npm i -SE @signageos/front-applet
```

## Initiate signageOS CLI and login

Login with your signageOS Account and follow the guide in the terminal
```shell
sos login
```

Select your Organization under which you generated your Applet in 
the step 1

```shell
sos organization set-default
```

## Build the project and test it locally

To run the SMIL Player, make sure you build it first.

```shell
npm install && npm run prepare

sos applet start --applet-dir dist --entry-file-path dist/index.html
```

Now you should be able to open up your web browser on http://Your-IP-Address:8090 and see the project running. Do your changes, if necessary, and continue with the next step.

## Login to signageOS CLI and upload your version to signageOS

###Â Adjust package.json file

1. Open up package.json file in the root folder of the project
1. Check the 5th line main and make sure there is dist/index.html
1. Change the appletUid to YOUR Applet UID from the Step 1

```json title="Add your Applet UID into package.json"
{
  "name": "@signageos/smil-player",
  "version": "5.2.0",
  "description": "SMIL player",
  // highlight-start
  "main": "dist/index.html",
  // highlight-end
  "files": [
    "dist",
    "README.md",
    "CHANGELOG.md",
    "package.json"
  ],
  ...
    omited items..
  ...
  "sos": {
    // highlight-start
    "appletUid": "41240bf563bac504af...e06dfeb6824"
    // highlight-end
  }
}
```

### Upload to signageOS

Make sure you build your project before running the sos applet upload.

```shell
// build the project
npm run build-prod

// upload to signageOS
sos applet upload --entry-file-path dist/index.html
```

## Next Steps

Now you have successfully uploaded your SMIL Player into the signageOS and you can start deploying it to supported device.
